The objectives of the DiFlex pipeline
=======================================

Diflex was developed to:

*1. Allow biologists to perform differential expression analysis on RNA-seq experiment data, without prior experience in bio-informatics.*

*2. Use widely available open source tools, so that the pipeline can be easily be expanded with features needed by it's users.*
