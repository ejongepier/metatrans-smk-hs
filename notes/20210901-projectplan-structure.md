# Project plan

To help structure your project and stay on track it is important to start with a project plan. 
Here are some suggestions and links to help you get started but if you already have instructions for that from school just follow those.

## Structure

 - General overview of your project including the biological background and motivation. Include a flowchart (see below).
 - A section for each of the steps with details on why they need to be performed, how you intend to do that, which tools you will use and what potential pitfalls are.
 - Mmilestones with all relevant dates and deadlines, including a rough estimate when you expect each step to be finished.

### Flow chard

A flowchart is an excellent way to keep track of your progress, keep an eye on the bigger picture and explain your project plans to others.
To make sure your flowcharts can be easily interpreted by anybody, it is useful to follow some conventions. For a  brief overview, see e.g.
https://www.gliffy.com/blog/guide-to-flowchart-symbols.

There are several tools for generating flowcharts. I use Pencil (https://pencil.evolus.vn/Downloads.html),
but feel free to use another one if you are already familiar with that.

### Milestones

MILESTONES.md outlines the different deadlines and important dates. You should complement these with an estimate when you expect each step in your plan to be finished.
As it is often difficult to determine before hand how long different processes take, we will regularly revisit your milestones and update them where necesary.
You can add the milestones to the end of your plan.
