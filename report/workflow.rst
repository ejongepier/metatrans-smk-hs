DiFlex is a de novo meta-transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression pipeline. For the input the pipeline takes raw Illumina paired-end RNAseq libraries. The output contains the transcriptome assembly and the differential gene expression between treatments. The main tools that are used by the pipeline are FastQC, Trimmomatic and Trinity. DiFlex is a flexible, open source, user-friendly pipeline.
